'## Overview\n\nHOC is an all-day event held by computer engineering students at Shiraz University to familiarize high school students with coding. However, the event was held online due to COVID-19.\n\nI designed the UI/UX of the website with Adobe XD software. That was my first experience in designing UI/UX. Special thanks to Mr. Cena Saeedi for teaching and helping me in this project.\n\n## More Images\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1xF64iPWOADyaiFZlnDq4SB7rBb5z9CzC)\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1XXVGdo1dJxnoKa7Q63scO53Ifdhxmqm0)\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=19pguk4PgErTzA7vZ1mlRIz3Ib40ckdC1)\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Ez_8e2QCEjM4il0y3awYmiPiiB9CLl32)\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1K0EZhDpf1miMJsd8EK_NAqvS_sczU38w)\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1v-Y7e1QrssE-JGYSnJOHCGqdm5O54s-W)\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Dt7UR3szhLtDmZD1WSdR1MfRVHNc3XUD)\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1qXq3Kr2D-8rAKoDAqzCHSRuMh8Hgh4b1)\n\n### Links\n[Live](https://hocshirazu.ir)'
