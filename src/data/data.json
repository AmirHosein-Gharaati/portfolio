We used Vue.js framework and Typescript in this project. Although this was my first experience in team development, but I learnd different things about frontend and technologies.\n\n## API calls\n\nWe used repository pattern, which makes API calls easier. Also this is a big challenge that we need to develop the frontend without interfering much with backend. This pattern made this easier to create fake client and mock data to do our job without stopping for backend team.\n\n## TypeScript\n\nCoding in TypeScript language is very important. TypeScript gave us a big advantage for setting the types of variables, parameters and interfaces to develop faster and make sure our code runs correctly. I learned the basics of TypeScript in this project.\n\n\n### Links\n[Live](https://trk.alimahdiyar.ir/)",
