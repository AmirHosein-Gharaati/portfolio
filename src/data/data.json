We used Vue.js framework and Typescript in this project. Although this was my first experience in team development, but I learnd different things about frontend and technologies.\n\n## API calls\n\nWe used repository pattern, which makes API calls easier. Also this is a big challenge that we need to develop the frontend without interfering much with backend. This pattern made this easier to create fake client and mock data to do our job without stopping for backend team.\n\n## TypeScript\n\nCoding in TypeScript language is very important. TypeScript gave us a big advantage for setting the types of variables, parameters and interfaces to develop faster and make sure our code runs correctly. I learned the basics of TypeScript in this project.\n\n\n### Links\n[Live](https://trk.alimahdiyar.ir/)",

This operation is called upon the arrival of a patient.   \n* *Serve First*  \n  This operation serves the patient in the data structure that arrived the\nearliest, and removes her from the dataset.  \n* *Serve Sickest*  \n  This operation serves the patient in the data structure that has the lowest\nhealth measure and removes her from the dataset.  \n* *Update X Y*  \n  This operation updates the health measure of the patient X to value Y.  \n  \nThe running time of each operation should be either O(log(n)) in the worst case, or O(1) in\nexpectation. Note that you are supposed to implement any data structure that you need\nyourself. You are not allowed to use data structures from the standard library of your\nprogramming language or from the internet.  \nThe input is a list of queries, with one query per line. Whenever a patient is served (either\nthrough Serve First or Serve Sickest), write the patient’s ID followed by a space and the\npatient's health measure at the serving time, and move to the next line.\nThe queries are set such that the number of patients in the data structure is always less than or\nequal to 10^6. However, the total number of patients that are inserted to the data structure and\nserved is not limited.  \n\n## Links\n[Github](https://github.com/AmirHosein-Gharaati/DataStructure-Project)",
