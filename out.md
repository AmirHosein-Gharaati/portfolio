## Overview

HOC is an all-day event held by computer engineering students at Shiraz University to familiarize high school students with coding. However, the event was held online due to COVID-19.

I designed the UI/UX of the website with Adobe XD software. That was my first experience in designing UI/UX. Special thanks to Mr. Cena Saeedi for teaching and helping me in this project.
